# NLP Bible and Quran Analyis


## Project Overview

In this project I will be exploring the method of NLP (Natural Language Processing) to see how negative or positive the text in the Bible and Quran are.By adding the ascent and spaceytextblog pipelines to the spacy model, I will be able to extract the polarity which is a number on a scale from -1 to 1 denoting how "positive" or "negative" text are.
